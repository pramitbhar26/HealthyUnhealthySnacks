Create a dashboard with 2 categories of grocery items. Category 1 - healthy snacks & Category 2 - unhealthy snacks.
Each category will be displayed with grocery items with their name & price along with a checkbox to select the grocery item & a textfield to select the quantity. Example - Lays tangy(). Max items under each category is 5. A submit button is to be provided at the bottom of the dashboard.
Items under each category should only open when the category name is selected. Note: No page load should happen here.
Please note that to add products, we will have to provide an interface. Where admin can login and add the products in the inventory.
After the items are selected and the submit button is clicked, a new form should open at the bottom with below fields:
    Name of the customer
    Email of the customer
    Phone number of the customer
    Total payable amount - this field should be disabled and auto-populated based on the items selected previously
    A submit button - On click of this submit button below actions should be performed:
    An email should be triggered to shuva.mallick@innoraft.com with the above details
    The above details should be stored in a file with the name of the customer as entered in the Name field.
